        <p class="Descript">
            ARomantic is a conecpt derived from the idea that someone could be percieved as being either a romanitc or aromantic. Two polar opposite meanings that have a magnitiude affect on anyone's personality. Bringing the meaning into the brand we want to show people that they can expand their perception along that spectrum between the two polar opposites and you can find a healthy sense of style, art and community together. This site is a landing page for someone to explore and share there perspective so we can see more eye to eye. </p>
